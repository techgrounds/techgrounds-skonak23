# SEC-07 (concept) - Passwords

In this Assigment we will take a deeper dive into the concept of 'passwords'and the strategies that can be used for creating and storing passwords. Furtheremore we will take a look at the concept of hashing and why it is preferred over symmetric encryption for storing passwords.

Passwords can be understood as secret codes that grant access to a particular system or account. They are designed to verify our identity and ensure that only authorized individuals can gain entry. While passwords might seem simple on the surface, there is an intricate back-end process that ensures their effectiveness

When we create a password, it's important to implement strategies that enhance its strength. A strong password should be unique, long, and contain a combination of letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters. It is crucial to avoid using common phrases or easily guessable information like birthdates or names, as these can make passwords vulnerable to hacking attempts.

By employing effective strategies, such as creating strong and unique passwords, and using technologies like hashing, we can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access to information that is confidential.


## Key-terms

- [x] <strong>hashing</strong> -> A way to convert information, like a password, into a scrambled code that cannot be easily reversed. Principle how it works: you assign a numeric or alphanumeric string to (a piece of data) by applying a function whose output values are all the same number of bits in length
- [x] <strong>Rainbow Table</strong> -> precomputed table that contains a vast number of possible passwords and their corresponding hash values. It is used as a hacking tool to crack passwords based on their hash values.
- [x] <strong>MD5</strong> (Message Digest Algorithm 5) -> a cryptographic hash function that produces a fixed-size (128bit) hash value from an input such as a password or a piece of data. 
- [x] <strong>Salting</strong> ->


## Requirements

- [x] A peer
- [x] Your linux machine
- [x] An online Rainbow Table like https://crackstation.net/



## Tasks

- [x] Find out what hashing is and why it is preferred over symmetric encryption for storing passwords.
- [x] Find out how a Rainbow Table can be used to crack hashed passwords.
- [x] Below are two MD5 password hashes. One is a weak password, the other is a string of 16 randomly generated characters. Try to look up both hashes in a Rainbow Table.

- [x] Create a new user in Linux with the password 12345. Look up the hash in a Rainbow Table.
- [x] Despite the bad password, and the fact that Linux uses common hashing algorithms, you wonâ€™t get a match in the Rainbow Table. This is because the password is salted. To understand how salting works, find a peer who has the same password in /etc/shadow, and compare hashes.

Hashing example:
```
[Text]					[Hash]
hello my name is sinan			-> 77add1d5f41223d5582fca736a5cb335
hello					-> 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592
```
Hashes stay a fixed length, in the example above (MD5) 128 bit, so 32 characters long. no matter the length of the text input.

So why would one prefer hashing over symmetric encryption for storing passwords? 
The technique that is used for hashing makes it a one-way process. So once a password is hashed, it is practically impossible to turn it back to the original password. This not the case for symmetric encryption

A rainbow table is ineffective against one-way hashes that include large salts
The salt value is not secret and may be generated at random and stored with the password hash. A large salt value prevents precomputation attacks, including rainbow tables, by ensuring that each user's password is hashed uniquely
