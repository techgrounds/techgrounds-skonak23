# SEC-03 - Identity and Access Management

In this Assigment we will take a deeper dive into the concept of Identity and Access Management.

Security in computer systems involves two important steps: authentication and authorization. These steps are crucial in ensuring that only authorized individuals gain access to sensitive resources.

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. When you log in to a computer or an online service, authentication ensures that you are who you claim to be. This is typically achieved by providing a combination of something you know (like a password), something you have (like a security token), or something you are (like a fingerprint).

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a popular method to enhance security during authentication. It involves combining two or more authentication factors to further validate the user's identity. For example, in addition to a password, MFA may require a unique code generated by a mobile app or a fingerprint scan. By using multiple factors, the risk of unauthorized access is significantly reduced.

Authorization, on the other hand, is the process of granting or denying access to specific resources or actions based on the authenticated user's permissions. Following the principle of least privilege is a best practice in authorization. It means that users are granted the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.



## Key-terms

- [x] <strong>Authorization</strong> -> a process by which a server determines if the client has permission to use a resource or access a file.
- [x] <strong>Authentication</strong> -> Verifying the identity of a user, process, or device, often as a prerequisite to allowing access to resources in an information system
- [x] <strong>MFA</strong> (Multi-factor authentication) -> a multi-step account login process that requires users to enter more information than just a password
