# SEC-05 - Asymmetric Encryption

In this Assigment we will take a deeper dive into the concept of asymmetric encryption.







It is often used in combination with symmetric encryption to establish secure communication channels. For example, symmetric encryption is used for bulk data encryption, while asymmetric encryption is used to securely exchange the symmetric keys.






## Key-terms


- [x] <strong>Asymmetric (key) Encryption</strong> ->  type of encryption that uses two separates yet mathematically related keys (public key - private key) to encrypt and decrypt data
- [x] <strong>Cryptography</strong> -> Refers to the science of encrypting and decrypting. It explains the method of protecting information and communication through the use of (secret) codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it

### Strengths / Weaknesses

Asymmetric encryption :  

        +     provides a secure way for communication even if the public key is intercepted by others.

		-     is computationally more intensive and slower compared to symmetric encryption.





## Requirements

- [x] The Slack channel your share with your entire cohort
- [x] A peer (Member of my team)
- [x] A key pair generator like https://travistidwell.com/jsencrypt/demo/




## Tasks

- [x] Generate a key pair.
- [x] Find two digital ciphers that are being used today. 

- [x] Send an asymmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key. The recipient should be able to read the message, but it should remain a secret to everyone else. You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides the public Slack channel. Analyse the difference between this method and symmetric encryption.
