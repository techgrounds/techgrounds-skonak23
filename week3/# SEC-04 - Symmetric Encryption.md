# SEC-04 (concept) - Symmetric Encryption

In this Assigment we will take a deeper dive into the concept of (symmetric) encryption.

Encryption is a fundamental concept in computer security that involves converting information into a secret or encrypted form, making it unreadable to unauthorized individuals. It is like using a secret code to protect your messages or data from being understood by anyone who doesn't have the key to decipher it.

It's an important tool to secure our digital communications, protect personal information, and ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data. It is used in various applications, such as secure messaging, data storage, and protecting sensitive information like passwords and financial details.




## Key-terms

- [x] <strong>Encryption</strong> -> a method by which information is converted into secret code that hides the information's true meaning. In IT, it is a way to scramble data so that only authorized parties can unscramble it.
- [x] <strong>Decryption</strong> -> The conversion of encrypted data into its original form.
- [x] <strong>Ciphers</strong> -> methods or algorithms used to convert information into a secret or encrypted form.
- [x] <strong>Symmetric (key) Encryption</strong> -> method of encryption where the same secret key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data, like a shared secret code between sender and receiver.
- [x] <strong>Simple Encryption</strong> -> Transforms Plaintext into Cipher text.
- [x] <strong>Cryptography</strong> -> Refers to the science of encrypting and decrypting. It explains the method of protecting information and communication through the use of (secret) codes, so that only those for whom the information is intended can read and process it
- [x] <strong>Ciphertext</strong> -> encrypted text transformed from plaintext using an encryption algorithm
- [x] <strong>Plaintext</strong> -> ordinary readable text before it is encrypted into ciphertext, or readable text after it is decrypted.

### Strengths / Weaknesses

Symmetric encryption :  

        	+     efficient and fast for encrypting large amounts of data.

		-     requires sharing the secret key between the sender and receiver beforehand, thus less secure.
		-     key management becomes more complex as the number of participants increases.





## Requirements

- [x] The Slack channel your share with your entire cohort
- [x] A peer (Member of my team)




## Tasks

- [x] Find one more historic cipher besides the Caesar cipher.
- [x] Find two digital ciphers that are being used today. 

- [x] Send a symmetrically encrypted message to one of your peers via the public Slack channel. They should be able to decrypt the message using a key you share with them. Try to think of a way to share this encryption key without revealing it to everyone. You are not allowed to use any private messages or other communication channels besides the public Slack channel. Analyse the shortcomings of symmetric encryption for sending messages.

### Problems experienced

None.


### Result(s)

*Below you will find the images showing the results along with their descriptions*

**Vigenère cipher** -> encryption method named after *Blaise de Vigenère*. It uses a keyword or phrase as a key to encrypt and decrypt messages and works by shifting the letters of the message based on the corresponding letters of the keyword.

- Two digital ciphers that are being used today:

1. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) -> A symmetric encryption algorithm that is adopted as the standard encryption method by worldwide industries, governments and organizations. It supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits and is known for its security, efficiency, and flexibility.

2. Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) -> an asymmetric encryption algorithm. It is an old one that is used widely for secure data transmission.
