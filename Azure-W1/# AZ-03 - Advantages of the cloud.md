# AZ-03 - Advantages of the cloud

In this Assigment we will take a deeper dive into the 'advantages of the cloud'.

The advantages of cloud computing, including high availability, scalability, and the pay-as-you-go model, delivers customers more reliable and accessible resources, the ability to adapt to changing demands, and cost-effective utilization of cloud services. These advantages have transformed the way businesses operate, providing agility and cost efficiency amongst other benefits.


## What are the six advantages of Cloud Computing?

- High Availability: 
```
When you're setting up and using an application, service, or IT resources, it's crucial that those resources are accessible and ready to use whenever you need them. High availability aims to ensure that these resources are consistently available, regardless of any interruptions or incidents that might happen.

When designing your solution, it's important to consider the assurance of service availability. Azure, as a cloud platform, provides a highly reliable and accessible environment with specific guarantees for uptime. The level of uptime assurance varies depending on the specific service you're using. These assurances are documented in service-level agreements (SLAs), which outline the commitment of Azure to maintaining the availability of its services.
```
- Scalability:
```
- Increase or decrease the resources and services used based on the demand or workload at any given time
- Horizontal scaling
	-Scaling "out"
	-Adding more servers that function together as one unit
- Vertical scaling
	-Scaling "up"
	-Adding resources to increase the power of an existing server
Scaling can be done manually or automatically based on e.g.
specific triggers such as CPU utilization
```

- Elasticity:
```
Cloud computing system can automatically add & remove resources to meet the current demand.
Examples:
	- Add resources for the peak operating hours during which most people access the application (Only pay for increased resources during those hours)
	- Remove the resources when the traffic normalizes (Maintain or reduce costs)
```

- Agility:
```
Quickly and easily adapt and respond to changing business needs
-rapidly scale resources, such as computing power and storage, on-demand
-be more agile in deploying applications, launching new services, and adapting to fluctuations in demand, ultimately enabling faster time-to-market
```
- Geo-distribution:
```
-datacenters located in various regions all over the globe
-Enables local presence close to your customers to give them the best response time
-Replicate your services into multiple regions for redundancy and locality
-specific regions you can select to meet data-residency and compliance laws for your customers.
```
- Disaster recovery (reliability):
```
-reduced lost end-user productivity from data loss
-Faster recovery time 
-Redundancy is built into cloud services architecture so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place this is referred to as <fault tolerance> and it ensures that your customers aren't impacted when a disaster occurs.
```

## Consumption-Based Model (Azure)
This model offers a flexible and cost-effective approach to utilizing cloud resources. It allows users to pay for the resources they consume, scale resources as needed, and optimize costs based on actual usage, ultimately providing a more tailored and cost-efficient cloud experience

Pay-as-you-go: You're billed only for what you use.
