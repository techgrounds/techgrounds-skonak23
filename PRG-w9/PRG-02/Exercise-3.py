### PRG-02 Variables
### 
### A variable can store a value. This value can then be accessed with the variable name in the code. 
### This is useful if you want to use one value multiple times, or if you want to dynamically change the value.

### Exercise 3 : 
"""
Create a new script.
Create a variable and assign a value to it.
Print the text “Value 1: <value 1 here>”.
Change the value of that same variable.
Print the text “Value 2: <value 2 here>”.
Change the value of that same variable.

"""



### Variables along with their values are created. The result gets printed after each variable with 'print' 

var = "sinan"
print("Value 1:", var)
var = "konak"
print("Value 2:", var)
var = "2023"
print("Value 3:", var)
