------------------------------------
### General:
Q: What regions allowed for deployment?

*A*: 2 VNets peered with eachother. 1 region, multiple availability zones

Q: What type of storage for the postDeploymentScripts?

*A*: Use basic storage, opt for the cheapest options.

------------------------------------------
### Network:
Q: Only 1 NSG per Virtual Network? or do you want to add extra NSG in the future?

*A*: Each VNet coupled with a NSG and corresponding rules

Q: IP range for the NSG, /24 seems very big for just one server per NSG.

*A:* In the future additional changes could be required. For now current design should be sufficient.

Q: Is the NSG sufficient as a firewall?

*A:* Yes. 

Q: Has the peering full access or are there ports blocked by default?

*A:* reported in project document

Q: Why does the client want the webserver in AvailZone 1 and the Mngmntserver in AvailZone 2?

*A:* ProjectTeam is free to implement as they like. 

-------------------------------------------------------
### Webserver:

Q: Preferred distribution?

*A*: SSH/RDP dependant. (linux = SSH) (Windows = RDP)

Q: Preferred size (compute power)?

*A*: Go for the bigger one if needed. Go for free tier if possible, or one above that if budget allows.

Q: Disk type, ssd/hdd lrs/grs?

*A*: Minimum, if needed go up in tier.

Q: What is the required uptime for the webserver

*A*: Free to implement as we like ? Assume 24/7 scenario

Q: What is the reasoning that the Webserver and Management server are put in different regions in the diagram attachment? 

*A*: Same answer as (last network question)

Q: Can the webserver and admin server be deployed in the same resource group?

*A*: yes

Q: Does the client want to manage disk encryption with platform-managed keys, or his/her own keys?

*A*: Key-Vault. Azure Managed.

--------------------------
### Adminserver:

Same Questions + Answers as Network/Webserver apply 

--------------------------------------------

### RBAC:

Q: What roles are there in the organization?

*A*: 1 role Admin. -> access (other servers) via Management Server

Q: What is everyone allowed to do?

*A*: Webserver > public ip ? . Management> only accessible by admin.
