## IaC Project - V1.0

### Deliverable 1

#### [Requirements]

----------------------------------

This documents shows an overview of the requirements which have been set by the Company and forwarded to the development team by the Product Owner.

As a team, it is important to us that we have a clear understanding of what this project requires from us. Therefore a descriptive documentation of our assignment for this project should lay out our first Deliverable.

---------------------------------

#### List of requirements provided by PO

The following list needs to be complemented by input from the team and from information gathered throughout the project. (This includes briefings with the PO)

- All VM disks must be encrypted.
- The webserver should be backed up daily. The backups should be retained for 7 days.
- The webserver must be installed in an automated manner.
- The admin/management server should be accessible with a public IP.
- The admin/management server should only be accessible from trusted locations (office/adminâ€™s home).
- The following IP ranges are used: ``` 10.10.10.0/24 & 10.20.20.0/24 ```
- All subnets should be protected by a subnet-level firewall.
- SSH or RDP connections to the webserver are only allowed to be established from the admin server.
- Feel free to propose or implement improvements in the architecture, but make definitive choices to meet the deadline.
